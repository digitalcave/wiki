Wiki to DIG and found the correct answer

We DIG in order to make our cave larger! A big cave has enough space for everything and everyone, and atracts avid Minecraft fans.

DIG, besides dig, stand for a lot of things, like:
* Develop In Group
* Discover Inner Greatness
* Dwell In Groovy
* Don't Incentivate Garbage
* Delta Ipsilon Gamma (our non existant fraternity cave ?)

Keep on digging!
